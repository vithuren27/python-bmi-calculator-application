# Python - BMI Calculator Application

This program allows users to calculate the body mass index. The formula used to perform this calculation is as follows:

weight in kg / height in metres squared

This tool will help anyone assess how their weight fares with their height and at what weight they should be to maintain a normal healthy weight. The ranges are as follows:

- Obese Class 3 = BMI > 40
- Obese Class 2 = 40 > BMI > 35
- Obese Class 1 = 35 > BMI > 30
- Overweight = 30 > BMI > 25
- Normal Weight = 25 > BMI > 18.5
- Thin = 18.5 > BMI > 17
- Very Thin = BMI < 17

The tool will require the user to enter their height and weight and then the Calculate button can be clicked to generate the BMI value and the status. The Reset button will clear all entries.
